            As reported by Automotive News, the lawsuit was filed earlier this month in Michigan by a former employee, Daniel Donovan, who was fired in early December.
            The suit alleges that VW deleted data for three days in September, after the company was notified that vehicles equipped with its 2.0-liter TDI engines
            violated U.S. emissions standards. It also claims the company’s IT department also failed to preserve backup disks. Donovan, who was responsible
            for information management and product liability cases, says in his lawsuit that he reported the deletions to his supervisor.
